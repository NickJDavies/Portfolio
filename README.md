PortfolioHwWk2

Couldnt quite get the image in aboutme right, wouldnt scale properly on lower sized screens. Was overall a little hesitant to use lots of divs, so I probably should have used more?

Portfolio is currently just pictures of one of my cat with captions from the images given, since theres nothing much to add so far.

I couldnt figure out how to change the background colour, so its just white for the moment.
